/*Conditional test:  
Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction 
for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this: 
let car = 'subaru'; 
console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.") 
console.log(car == 'subaru') 
• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False. 
• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False. */
